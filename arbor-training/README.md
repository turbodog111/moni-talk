# Arbor Training Data

All Arbor fine-tuning material has moved to a dedicated private repo:

**[turbodog111/moni-talk-models](https://github.com/turbodog111/moni-talk-models)**

That repo contains training data, generation/curation/evaluation scripts,
documentation, and the full model history.

Files previously here:
- `SETUP.md` → `docs/SETUP.md` in moni-talk-models
- `TRAINING-PARAMS.md` → `docs/TRAINING-PARAMS.md` in moni-talk-models
