# moni-talk Changelog

Versions follow **v0.MAJOR.PATCH** — MAJOR increments for new feature releases, PATCH for fixes and polish within a release.

---

## v0.7.1 — Settings & Server Fixes (2026-02-22)

- Fix: stale model ID in localStorage caused "model not found" after switching between Arbor and router mode
- Add "(server default)" blank option to model dropdown — correct choice for Arbor single-model mode; omits `model` field from API requests so the server uses whatever is loaded
- Fix: Tailscale serve syntax (`--set-path` flag required for path routing)
- Fix: Tailscale serve config persists across Spark reboots (not wiped like WSL2)
- SETUP.md: Promote Qwen3-TTS to primary TTS, trim Tailscale routes to 8080 + 8880 only

## v0.7.0 — Arbor 0.1 (2026-02-22)

- **Arbor 0.1**: fine-tuned Qwen3-14B-Instruct for Monika chat mode (Q8_0, ~14.6 GB)
- Add `chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: false }` to llama.cpp API calls — suppresses Qwen3 `<think>` blocks during inference
- SETUP.md: Arbor single-model mode (tmux) vs router mode documented; LLaMA-Factory section with full training → export → GGUF workflow
- Qwen3-TTS promoted to primary TTS; Orpheus demoted to optional/legacy
